# Multilingual Chatbot with OpenAI GPT & Google Translate

A lightweight, zero-cost prototype that chats in English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (extendable to 130+ languages) by combining the power of OpenAIâ€™s GPT models with free Google Translate service via deep-translator.

## Features

### Capability	Details
- Automatic language detection:	uses langdetect to identify the userâ€™s language (any script).
- Bi-directional translation:	routes non-English input through Google Translate, sends the English text to GPT, then returns GPTâ€™s answer translated back to the original language.
- GPT integration: defaults to gpt-3.5-turbo.
- 100 % free translation:	relies on Google Translateâ€™s public endpoints via deep-translator, no Google Cloud key needed.
